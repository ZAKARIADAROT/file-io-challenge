WELCOME TO THE FILE READ & WRITE CHALLENGE!

THIS PROGRAM WILL:
1. READ THIS FILE
2. CONVERT ALL TEXT TO UPPERCASE
3. SAVE THE MODIFIED VERSION TO A NEW FILE

FUN FACT: PYTHON WAS CREATED BY GUIDO VAN ROSSUM IN 1991.

ERROR HANDLING TEST CASES:
- MISSING FILE? ✔️ HANDLED!
- PERMISSION ISSUES? ✔️ HANDLED!
- EMPTY FILE? ✔️ WORKS TOO!

NOW YOU'RE READY TO TEST THE PROGRAM!
