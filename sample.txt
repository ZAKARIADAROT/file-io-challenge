Welcome to the File Read & Write Challenge!

This program will:
1. Read this file
2. Convert all text to UPPERCASE
3. Save the modified version to a new file

Fun fact: Python was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991.

ERROR HANDLING TEST CASES:
- Missing file? ✔️ Handled!
- Permission issues? ✔️ Handled!
- Empty file? ✔️ Works too!

Now you're ready to test the program!
